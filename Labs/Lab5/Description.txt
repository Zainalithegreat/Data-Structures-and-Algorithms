This C++ program implements functions for counting the number of nodes in a circular linked list iteratively and recursively, as well as functions for calculating the sum of the data stored in the nodes iteratively and recursively. The iterative count and sum functions traverse the circular list using a do-while loop, while the recursive count and sum functions utilize helper functions to recursively traverse the list until reaching the starting node again. These functions are defined to work with a circular linked list implemented using the provided node structure.
